# NEED TO UPDATE THIS, I'VE IMPLEMENTED LOADS OF THINGS AND TURNS OUT THAT MY
# PREDICIVE PARSER CAN BE EASILY CONVERTED INTO A *REAL* PREDICIVE PARSER
# Automatic Parser
# WARNING, ADDING SOME OTHER PARSERS AND STUFF!!!!
## Simple project aiming to implement a *generic* recursive descent parser
## It can do *anything* a predictive recursive parser can do
You can find an input example in "Ea" file
## Grammar conditions:
#### 1. No left recursions
#### 2. The complete derivation of a production can't be the "first"\* of another production
2.1\*It's not a single terminal, but an ordered set of them

#### It can do more then a predictive parser, but it's not all might, it's a Midoriya ;)
